In order for the mapping to work correctly and go at a reasonable speed you must compile the 'mapping' package differenty from the others.

First compile everything as normal:
(navigate to workspace top directory)

$ catkin_make

Then you need to compile mapping as 'Release' version:

$ catkin_make --pkg mapping -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
